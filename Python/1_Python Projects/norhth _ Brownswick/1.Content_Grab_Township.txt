/* Settable values for skinning a Basic menu via presets. If presets are not sufficient, most skinning should be done in
	these rules, with the exception of the images used for down or right pointing arrows, which are in the file SpryMenuBasic.css
	
	 These assume the following widget classes for menu layout (set in a preset)
	.MenuBar - Applies to all menubars - default is horizontal bar, all submenus are vertical - 2nd level subs and beyond are pull-right.
	.MenuBarVertical - vertical main bar; all submenus are pull-right.
	
	You can also pass in extra classnames to set your desired top level menu bar layout. Normally, these are set by using a preset. 
	They only apply to horizontal menu bars:
		MenuBarLeftShrink - The menu bar will be horizontally 'shrinkwrapped' to be just large enough to hold its items, and left aligned
		MenuBarRightShrink - Just like MenuBarLeftShrink, but right aligned
		MenuBarFixedLeft - Fixed at a specified width set in the rule '.MenuBarFixedLeft', and left aligned.  
		MenuBarFixedCentered -  - Fixed at a specified width set in the rule '.MenuBarFixedCentered', 
						and centered in its parent container.
		MenuBarFullwidth - Grows to fill its parent container width.
 
	In general, all rules specified in this file are prefixed by #MenuPublic1 so they only apply to instances of the widget inserted along
	with the rules. This permits use of multiple MenuBarBasic widgets on the same page with different layouts. Because of IE6 limitations,
	there are a few rules where this was not possible. Those rules are so noted in comments.

/* IE6 rules - you can delete these if you do not want to support IE6 */

/* A note about multiple classes in IE6.
 * Some of the rules above use multiple class names on an element for selection, such as "hover" (MenuItemHover) and "has a subMenu" (MenuItemWithSubMenu),
 * giving the selector '.MenuItemWithSubMenu.MenuItemHover'.
 * Unfortunately IE6 does not support using mutiple classnames in a selector for an element. For a selector such as '.foo.bar.baz', IE6 ignores
 * all but the final classname (here, '.baz'), and sets the specificity accordingly, counting just one of those classs as significant. To get around this 
 * problem, we use the plugin in SpryMenuBarIEWorkaroundsPlugin.js to generate compound classnames for IE6, such as 'MenuItemWithSubMenuHover'. 
 * Since there are a lot of these needed, the plugin does not generate the extra classes for modern browsers, and we use the CSS2 style mutltiple class
 * syntax for that. Since IE6 both applies rules where 
 * it should not, and gets the specificity wrong too, we have to order rules carefully, so the rule misapplied in IE6 can be overridden. 
 * So, we put the multiple class rule first. IE6 will mistakenly apply this rule.  We follow this with the single-class rule that it would 
 * mistakenly override, making sure the  misinterpreted IE6 specificity is the same as the single-class selector, so the latter wins. 
 * We then create a copy of the multiple class rule, adding a '.SpryIsIE6' class as context, and making sure the specificity for
 * the selector is high enough to beat the single-class rule in the "both classes match" case. We place the IE6 rule at the end of the 
 * css style block to make it easy to delete if you want to drop IE6 support.
 * If you decide you do not need IE6 support, you can get rid of these, as well as the inclusion of the SpryMenuBarIEWorkaroundsPlugin.js script.
 * The 'SpryIsIE6' class is placed on the HTML element by  the script in SpryMenuBarIEWorkaroundsPlugin.js if the browser is Internet Explorer 6. This avoids the necessity of IE conditional comments for these rules.
